## üöÄ Quick Start
### Running the Engine
```bash
cargo run --release
```
### Tests
```
cargo test
```

### Benchmark
The benchmark shows the performance for each of the compute shaders at the end of the execution. It creates `benchmark.json` file that can be visualized at `edge://tracing/` or `chrome://tracing/`. 
```
cargo run --release --features benchmark
```


## üîß Implementation Details

### GPU Spatial Grid Partitioning
The engine uses a sophisticated spatial partitioning system that divides the simulation space into a uniform grid. Each particle is assigned to grid cells, dramatically reducing the number of collision checks from O(n¬≤) to approximately O(n*k) in most cases.

### GPU Collision Response
All collision detection and response calculations are performed in parallel on the GPU using compute shaders, allowing for real-time simulation of millions of interacting particles.

### Verlet Integration
The engine employs Verlet integration for numerical stability and energy conservation, ensuring smooth and realistic particle motion over time.

## Morton encoding
Every 4 seconds, the particles are sorted using morton codes to improve cache locality. 

### Current Limitations
- **2D Only**: Currently supports 2D simulations
- **Circle Shapes**: Only circular particles are supported at this time

## üìä Performance

**Test Configuration:**
- **GPU**: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (with severe thermal throttling)
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Build**: Release mode (`--release`)
- **Gravity**: disabled

The engine demonstrates excellent scaling characteristics, maintaining smooth framerates even with millions of active particles thanks to GPU parallelization.
